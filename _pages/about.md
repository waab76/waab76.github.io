## What is Distributed Chaos?

Distributed Chaos is a grassroots initiative to foster local hacker communities worldwide. We believe in the power of face-to-face connections and hands-on learning in the hacker and security community.

## Our Mission

To provide a lightweight framework that enables local hacker groups to form, grow, and thrive while maintaining their independence and unique character.

## Core Values

- **Community First**: We prioritize building genuine connections and sharing knowledge
- **Decentralized**: No central authority - just a framework and shared principles
- **Open & Inclusive**: Everyone is welcome to participate and contribute
- **Educational**: Focus on learning and skill development
- **Independent**: Each group maintains its autonomy while sharing common values

## History

Distributed Chaos was born from the recognition that while online communities are valuable, there's something special about meeting fellow hackers face-to-face. We launched in 2024 with the goal of making it easier for local hacker communities to organize and connect.
