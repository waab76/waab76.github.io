# No Central Organization, Only Framework

Our goal is to provide a few simple organizing principles rather than to dictate how groups should operate. If your group agrees with our core principles, you're part of our hacker family. Beyond the core principles, we trust that you know best what will or won't work for your local hacker community.

## Be Good

[Security BSides](https://bsides.org) put forward a core ethos that we feel is worth following: "**Be good to, and for, the community.**"

## Be Active

A meetup group that never meets isn't much of a meetup group. Whether online or in meatspace, DCGs should meet at least quarterly.

## Be Open

Meetings should be open to the all. Diverse perspectives, experiences, and skills contribute to a richer and more innovative community.
